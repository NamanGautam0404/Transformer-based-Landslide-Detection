# Transformer-based Landslide Detection

This project implements a Transformer-based deep learning model for landslide detection using multispectral satellite imagery.

## Features
- Patch-based image embedding
- Positional encoding
- Transformer encoder architecture
- Custom Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics

## Dataset
Dataset is automatically downloaded using KaggleHub:
niyarrbarman/landslide-divided

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Transformers
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Results
- Achieved ~91% accuracy on test data
- Evaluated using IoU, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## Note
This code was developed and tested in Google Colab.
